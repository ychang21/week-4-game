###One of my favorite movies of all time is Star Wars. It is the ultimate story of good vs evil and so it makes it a perfect theme for a battle game. This game was built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery.

At the start of the game the player will choose a character by clicking on the character's picture. The player will play as that character for the rest of the game.

The player then chooses which enemy they will attack by clicking on that enemy's picture.
Once the player picks an enemy to fight, that enemy is moved to a defender area to do battle with the player.

The player will now be able to hit the attack button to fight against that defender.
Whenever the attack button is hit, the player's character is going to attack the defender character once. 
The defender character will then counter attack the player's character once.
When the player's character attacks, the defender will lose Health Points displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture.
When the defender counter attacks, the player's character will lose Health Points displayed at the bottom of the player character's picture.
Keep hitting the attack to try and defeat the defender.

When the defender's Health Points are reduced to 0 or below, they are removed from the defender area. The player can now pick a new enemy to attack.
The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters, and loses the game if the player's character Health Points are 0 or below.

Each character in the game has 3 attributes: Health Points, Attack Power, and Counter Attack Power.
Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power. So if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6. (12, 18, 24, 30 etc...).
The enemy character only has Counter Attack Power and their Counter Attack Power never changes.
The Health Points, Attack Power, and Counter Attack Power of each character are different.
None of the characters in the game can heal or recover Health Points, so the point of the game is to pick a character and fight an enemy that has low Counter Attack Power first and build up your own Attack Power before you lose all your Health Points.
Depending on game play, you can win or lose with any of the characters in the game.
